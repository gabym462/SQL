#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
select count(orderID)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderID)=6
and orderID<>'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
select count(orderID)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderID)=6
and orderID<>'Order ID'
and Product='iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
select distinct acctnum 
from BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER Join BIT_DB.FebSales feb
on cust.order_id=feb.orderID
where length(orderID)=6
and orderID<>'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
Select distinct product,price
from BIT_DB.JanSales
order by price asc Limit 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
Select sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
from BIT_DB.JanSales
Group by product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select product,sum(quantity), sum(quantity)*price as revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location= '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum)as customers,avg(quantity*price)as avg_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
